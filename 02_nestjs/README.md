# NestJS Backend

This is a starter NestJS backend. It comes with a test suite to get you started.

I've had a look and understand approx 10% of what is happening. I need to:

- Review the frontend (angular) and check how information is pulled through into the frontend)

- Do some js on codewars, to get me familiar with the syntax

- Do an introductory nest/angular app course

- Review the Acebook app and remind myself of the structure of js/ts client-server apps like this. Nest provides the architecture (https://github.com/nestjs/nest). It it a corollary to RoR, then?
- Also do some ts?
- Figure out what I am expected to do with this codebase. The only task we have been given is:
> Task: Create a client/server that provides a real time price stream for the
> following coins [BTC,ETH,XRP,LTC,BCH,ETC] and their value in the following
> currencies [USD,GBP,EUR,JPY,ZAR].
